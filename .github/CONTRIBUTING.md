# Building the project

> If you need to build this project for customization purposes, we strongly advise you to refer to our [samples](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/master/samples). If you cannot find any samples that fulfill your customization needs and you don't know how to do that, please [send your dream to us](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/issues/).
>
> Forking Web Chat to make your own customizations means you will lose access to our latest updates. Maintaining forks also introduces chores that are substantially more complicated than a version bump.

To build Web Chat, you will need to make sure both your Node.js and NPM is latest version (either LTS or current).

```sh
npm install
npm run bootstrap
npm run build
```

## Build tasks

There are 3 types of build tasks in the build process.

-  `npm run build`: Build for development (instrumented code for code coverage)
   -  Will bundle as `webchat-instrumented*.js`
-  `npm run watch`: Build for development with watch mode loop
-  `npm run prepublishOnly`: Build for production
   -  Will bundle as `webchat*.js`

## Testing Web Chat for development purpose

We built a playground app for testing Web Chat so we can test certain Web Chat specific features.

```sh
npm run start:playground
```

Then browse to http://localhost:3000/, and click on one of the connection options on the upper right corner.

-  Official MockBot: we hosted a live demo bot for testing Web Chat features
-  Emulator Core: it will connect to http://localhost:5000/v3/directline for [emulated Direct Line service](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/tree/master/packages/emulator/cli/)

You are also advised to test the CDN bundles by copying the test harness from our samples.

## Building CDN bundle in development mode

Currently, the standard build script does not build the CDN bundle (`webchat*.js`).

```sh
cd packages/bundle
npm run watch
```

> By default, this script will run in watch mode.

## Building CDN bundle in production mode

If you want to build a production CDN bundle with minification, you can follow these steps.

```sh
cd packages/bundle
npm run prepublishOnly
```

## Submitting a Pull Request
