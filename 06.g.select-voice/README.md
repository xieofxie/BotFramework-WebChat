## Selecting voice

To select a different voice for speech synthesis, pass a `selectVoice` function when creating Web Chat.

When Web Chat synthesizes an activity, it will call the `selectVoice` function with a list of voices available and the activity to be synthesized. The code should return the `SpeechSynthesisVoice` object to use for speech synthesis.

In the sample code below, if the activity is for language "zh-HK", we will use a voice with keyword "TracyRUS". Otherwise, it will choose a voice with keyword "JessaNeural" over "Jessa".

```diff
  window.WebChat.renderWebChat({
    directLine: window.WebChat.createDirectLine({ token }),
+   selectVoice: (voices, activity) =>
+     activity.locale === 'zh-HK'
+     ? voices.find(({ name }) => /TracyRUS/iu.test(name))
+     : voices.find(({ name }) => /JessaNeural/iu.test(name)) ||
+       voices.find(({ name }) => /Jessa/iu.test(name)),
    webSpeechPonyfillFactory
  }, document.getElementById('webchat'));
```

## Completed code

```js
window.WebChat.renderWebChat(
   {
      directLine: window.WebChat.createDirectLine({ token }),
      selectVoice: (voices, activity) =>
         activity.locale === 'zh-HK'
            ? voices.find(({ name }) => /TracyRUS/iu.test(name))
            : voices.find(({ name }) => /JessaNeural/iu.test(name)) || voices.find(({ name }) => /Jessa/iu.test(name)),
      webSpeechPonyfillFactory
   },
   document.getElementById('webchat')
);
```
